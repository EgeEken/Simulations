## [Flies and Flowers](https://github.com/EgeEken/Flies-and-Flowers)

Simulates a few flies and different types of flowers on a flat terrain. The flies have a pathfinding algorithm to find and move towards the nearest drop of nectar, the flowers secrete nectar in a random location around themselves every day, there is a sleeping routine that some flowers and all flies follow, all of them have independent sleep schedules. Venus flytraps can eat flies that pass over them if they aren't sleeping.
